# Julian Chavez's Protfolio

I am a computer science student at CSUF an I except to graduate at 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 6, part 2
  
    I enjoyed this lab because it was about blackjack and how to add up the score of the cards, even though the task was pretty straight forward, it was fun. I did have a little trouble with the ace card since it represents both 1 and 11.

* Lab 1
  
    I know that the lab itself was easy but Iâ€™m putting it here because that for me is where my computer science journey started and I think that's pretty cool. In this lab I learned how to declare strings and print text in this lab.

* Lab 9
  
    This lab is here because because I struggled in this lab, but this lab is also here becuase it felt good when I started to get the hang of it and when the code started working. In my eyes it shows that the coding we do is for a purpose, there is a value to doing these labs.
